Should filters on repeaters act on individual items rather then entire list?
Eg repeat="{{item in items : filter}}

filter: function(obj) {
  // should obb be an item or the items array?
}

Right now the filter is called once for the list (per assignment), not as 
individual items in the list change.

Yes, this makes sense, there's no magic in the repeat expression, it's the 'items' array.
To filter on individual items, use a nested template and if expression.
