Should filters on repeaters act on individual items rather then entire list?
Eg repeat="{{item in items : filter}}

filter: function(obj) {
  // should obb be an item or the items array?
}

Right now the filter is called once for the list (per assignment), not as 
individual items in the list change.

Yes, this makes sense, there's no magic in the repeat expression, it's the 'items' array.
To filter on individual items, use a nested template and if expression.

Binding scopes seems confusing ie named scopes keep the access to the parent
but otherwise not. 
Then again I wouldn't want to reinvent WPF's RelativeSource
Maybe require named scopes? That would keep it simple.

core-animation-pages seems to need 2 lists when animating items in a list. 
That would seem really expensive!
